    (PROBLEM)
    When you take pull, I mean clone the repo of which you are given access to, after cloning successfully
    and creating token as password, when you try to make your first commit and push, as soon as you do 
    `git status`, the console will be filled with all files marked as red, it means changes are made to all

    (SOLUTION)
    The solution to this problem is very simple, just hit this command
    `git config core.filemode false`
